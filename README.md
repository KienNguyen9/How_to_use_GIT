# HOW TO USE GIT

## CREATE A REPOSITOTY
### To create a new repository on GitHub, follow these steps:
1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in to your account.
2. Click the + button in the top right corner of the page.
3. Select New repository.
4. Enter a name for your repository and a short description.
5. Select whether you want your repository to be public or private.
6. Click Create repository.

   Once you have created a repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:
   ``` python
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```
This will create a new directory on your local machine with the same name as your repository. The directory will contain all of the files from your remote repository.
To pull changes from the remote repository to your local repository, run the following command:

``` python
   git pull origin master
```
